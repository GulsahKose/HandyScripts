# HandyScripts
Some useful scripts I use

**prettyxml.sh**

When run the script in a directory, it finds xml files recursively and corrects their indents for better readability

**compress.sh**

When run the script in a directory, it compreses the all files and directories in it with zip and rename the zipped file with given parameters.
eg: "compress.sh gulsah odt" creates gulsah.odt zipped file in parent directory.
